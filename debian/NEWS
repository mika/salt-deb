salt (0.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The default location for pki_dir, chachedir and sock_dir has changed
  and includes now the service as the last part of the directory, i.e.
  pki_dir has changed from /etc/salt/pki/ to /etc/salt/pki/master for the
  master and /etc/salt/pki/minion/ for the minion.

  The integrated migration from salt should move the necessary files
  automatically.
